Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (ciws) is an end to end system for residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis. It primarily has three components, namely ciws-node (data collection), ciws-server (back-end) and ciws-client (website/ mobile app).

This repository will contain data collection files for a testbed in USU's Learning and Living Centre housing facility. We will be building a data logger based on the Raspberry Pi framework to log data from commercial water meters with current loop outputs (4-20 mA).

A high level system architecutre diagram for data collection is as follows:
(TODO)

The primary contributions of this projct would include continuous autonomous data logging on a Raspberry Pi and subsequent data streaming to a backend server.

##Getting Started
(TODO)

##Development
Test code on your local machine/ rapsberry pi and push changes to this repository.

##Deployment
Pull the master branch to Raspberry Pi to begin data collection.

##Contribution
Fork and/ or branch git workflow
