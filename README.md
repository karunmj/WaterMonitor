Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (ciws) is an end to end system for residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis. It primarily has three components, namely ciws-node (data collection with raspberry pi), ciws-server (back-end) and ciws-client (website/ mobile app).

#ciws-campus-rpi
This repository will contain data collection files. We will be building a prototype with Raspberry Pi to log data from commercial water meters with pulsed or current loop outputs (4-20 mA) on USU's campus.
