# This script makes high frequency measurements of flow through water meters
# installed on USU's student residence hall buildings. It measures the
# 4-20 mA output of the meters and converts it to gallons per minute. It
# outputs flow rate, the incremental flow for each time period, and totalized
# flow since the program started.
#
# The sampling rate and data recording rate are configurable

# 1. Build program for multi meter sites

# Create an ADS1015 ADC (12-bit) instance with default address
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: the I2C address can be changed from its default address (0x48), and/or
# the I2C bus can be changed by passing in these optional parameters:
# adc = Adafruit_ADS1x15.ADS1015(address=0x49, busnum=1)
adc = Adafruit_ADS1x15.ADS1015()

# Choose a gain setting for the ADC
# ---------------------------------
# This setting changes the range of voltages that are read
# See table 3 in the ADS1015/ADS1115 datasheet for more info on gain.
#  - 2/3 = +/-6.144V 1 bit = 3 mV
#  -   1 = +/-4.096V 1 bit = 2 mV
#  -   2 = +/-2.048V 1 bit = 1 mV
#  -   4 = +/-1.024V 1 bit = 0.5 mV
#  -   8 = +/-0.512V 1 bit = 0.25 mV
